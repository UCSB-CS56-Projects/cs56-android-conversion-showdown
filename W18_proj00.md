## a

This project converts a java program to an android program. The main function of the application is to do calculation between numbers in different bases (decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal) and to test the users ability to do conversion among different bases.

## b
* As a user, I can enter my name and I am prompted with a welcome message and a menu so that I can choose which activity to do.
* As a user, I can begin the quiz and am shown score report at the end so I am informed at how well I did.
* As a user, I can use the base calculator to do the provided operations (add, subtract, and multiply) so that I can verify my math.
* As a user, I can use converter to convert between bases so that I can easily do conversions.

## c
The application is funtioning. I am able to enter my name and get a welcome message, to use the built-in calculator or convertor, and to start a customized quiz with desired type and difficulty to test my skills.

## d
* As a user, I can enter a customized base so that I can do calculation or conversion that is not limited to binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.
* As a user, I can review which question I missed on the quiz so that I can review the questions and improve my skills.

## e
The README.md file records explicitly and clearly the progress of entire software development and as well contains clean instructions on how to run the software. The format is clean and the content is easy to understand. However, it lacks essential information for folks maintaining the software to understand, such as how each class works together and dependency to the specific XML file.

## f
This is an android application developed in Android Studio, compiling and building is nicely handled by the IDE and therefore no build.xml is provided. It is based on Gradle, and there is sufficient documentation in the README.md that someone new to those tools has the information they need to get started.

## g
There are enough issues that I could earn 1000 points by working on this project. The description of each issue is very concise, but some of them need more clarification.

## h
There are no additional issues to be added at the moment.

## j
There are JUnit tests provided but they are not sufficient. Even though some basic functions of the application, such as calculation and conversion between different bases, are covered by the test, the quality and quantity of test cases definitely need to be improved. There are many opportunities to improve the tests for this application. We can tests the calculator for a vast amount of calculations. We can tests the quizing to see if the correct results are showing.
